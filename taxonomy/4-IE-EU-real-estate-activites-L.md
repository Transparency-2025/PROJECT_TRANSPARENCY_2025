> ***Legal Caveat:** These companies are provided as representative examples because their core business activity aligns perfectly with the NACE description. However, companies like these often operate under multiple NACE codes, and their definitive primary NACE classification is not a matter of public record, nor are they a comprehensive list of the 18,295 active enterprises.*
