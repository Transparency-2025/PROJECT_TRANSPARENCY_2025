### **Summary of the Irish Business Landscape**

To visualize the scale of these sectors in Ireland relative to one another:

  * **Dominant Sector:** The **Services** sector (Tertiary) is by far the largest by entity count, with over **240,000** active businesses.
  * **Key Growth Area:** The **Professional, Scientific & Technical** sector (51,608 entities) is a standout, surpassing traditional sectors like Wholesale/Retail, driven heavily by Ireland's hub status for consultancy, legal, and R\&D firms.
  * **Primary vs. Business:** While there are **\~135,000 farms**, they are often family-owned holdings. If you count them as "businesses," Agriculture is technically the largest single sector by entity count, though not by turnover or employment compared to the Corporate/FDI sectors.
