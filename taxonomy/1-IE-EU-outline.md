This list is fully compatible for both Ireland and the EU because both jurisdictions use the **NACE Rev. 2** standard (*Nomenclature of Economic Activities*).

This shared standard allows for seamless comparison of data (e.g., GDP, employment, trade) between Ireland and any other EU member state.

### **How to Read This Taxonomy**

To answer your specific request, I have mapped the official NACE codes into three distinct levels of granularity often used in business and economics:

  * **Level 1: Economic Sector** (The high-level economic function: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary).
  * **Level 2: Industry Sector** (The broad NACE "Section" used for high-level reporting).
  * **Level 3: Specific Industry** (The specific NACE "Division" defining the actual business activity).

### **Key Terminology Notes**

  * **NACE Code:** The alphanumeric code (e.g., C, J62) is the "key" that makes this compatible. If you are building a database, always store the NACE code.
  * **"Industry" vs. "Sector":** In Ireland (CSO) and EU (Eurostat) reporting, you will often see the term **"Business Economy"**. This typically refers to Sectors B through N (excluding Financial K and Public Admin O).
  * **The "A10" Aggregation:** For high-level economic reporting (like GDP growth), Ireland often groups these into just 10 mega-sectors (e.g., combining G, H, and I into "Distributive Trade & Transport"). The list above provides the detailed breakdown necessary for accurate classification.
